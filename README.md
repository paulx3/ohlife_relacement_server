# Ohlife Replacement Server
An replacement or alternative to Ohlife
## Overview
After Ohlife ,the Chinese alternative [juzishiguang](juzitime.com) also shutdown. 
After lots of searching, I found that those open source replacements are either limited in 
function or hard to deploy. So I came up with the idea using Flask to write an easy-to-deploy
Ohlife replacement.
## What is it?
This program sends you an email everyday (or any time period you set) with greetings.
All you have to do is reply this email and the reply content will be saved on the server.
Pretty much the same as the original Ohlife.
